# 1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word with all capital letters.

  # puts "Enter a word:"
  # word = gets.chomp
  # puts word.upcase

# 2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a big number" if the number is greater than 100.

  # puts "Enter a number:"
  # number = gets.chomp
  # if number.to_i > 100
  #   puts "Thats a big number"
  # end 

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.

  # puts "Enter 2 numbers"
  # numbers = gets.chomp
  # numbers = numbers.split
  # sum = numbers[0].to_i + numbers[1].to_i
  # puts sum

# 4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word in reverse order.

  # puts "Enter a word:"
  # word = gets.chomp
  # puts word.reverse

# 5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints the number times 10.
  
  # puts "Enter a number:"
  # number = gets.chomp
  # number = number.to_i
  # 10.times do
  # puts number
  # end 

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.

  # puts "Enter 2 words:"
  # word_1 = gets.chomp
  # word_2 = gets.chomp
  # puts "#{word_1.upcase} #{word_2.upcase}"

# 7. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints the number of letters in the word.

puts "Enter a word:"
word = gets.chomp
p word.length

# 8. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a negative number" if the number is less than 0.

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the two numbers multiplied together.

# 10. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints "That's a long word" if the word has more than 5 letters.
